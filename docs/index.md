This is an **Android app**[^1] to view the subtitle (transcript) files associated with videos in *JW Library*[^2] and on [JW.ORG](https://jw.org).

It allows:
- Saving/sharing the subtitle file locally
- Copying a portion of the text to clipboard
- Switching to another available language
- Generating a link to a portion of the video

In the *JW Library* app, share the link from a video to *jwlFission*.

If the video contains subtitles, they will be shown and you can save/share these transcripts in whole, or copy a portion to the clipboard (with or without the timestamps). You can also switch to the same transcript in any of the available languages. And you can select a starting point (or a section) and launch or copy the link to play that part of the video in the language you choose.
